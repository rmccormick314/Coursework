    <h1>Custom Fonts</h1>
    <p>
      To find and implement my custom font, I went on Google and searched,
      "how to add a custom font". From there, I found a website with several
      different sources of free custom fonts. I chose to use Google's free
      font repository.

      Next, I searched for "how to implement a custom font in HTML". Using the
      first guide I found on Geeks for Geeks, I was able to create a short
      CSS style sheet and implement my font on my website. The process was
      fairly easy and straightforward, and I would feel confident in doing it
      again, or in teaching someone else to do so.
