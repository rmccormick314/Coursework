"2","ggOceanMaps: Setting data download folder to a temporary folder
C:\Users\richard\AppData\Local\Temp\Rtmp6XFPIJ. This means that any downloaded map data
need to be downloaded again when you restart R. To avoid this problem, change the
default path to a permanent folder on your computer. Add following lines to your
.Rprofile file: {.ggOceanMapsenv <- new.env(); .ggOceanMapsenv$datapath <-
'YourCustomPath'}. You can use usethis::edit_r_profile() to edit the file.
'~/ggOceanMapsLargeData' would make it in a writable folder on most operating systems.
