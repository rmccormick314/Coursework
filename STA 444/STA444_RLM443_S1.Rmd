## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
title("Pressure vs. Temperature")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Go back to the “family” data frame you created for assignment 2.

• With one line of code, change the title of all 3 columns to “New Names”, “New Age”
and “New Height.”  
• With one line of code, give rows 1 – 4 the names “me”, “myself”, “and”, and “I”. If
you have fewer than 4 rows, choose the first n of the above labels, where n = the
number of rows in your data set. If you have more than 4 rows in your data set, only
rows 1 – 4 need to be re-labled. Note: currently, the rows are labeled “1” , “2”, etc.  
We are replacing those labels, not renaming the people in your family.  
• With one row of code, make the age of the 3rd member of your family “112.”  


``` {r}
family <- data.frame(
  Names = c('Rowy', 'Mom', 'Luke', 'Courtney'),
  Age   = c(21, 56, 29, 27),
  Height.in = c(76, 85, 68, 73) 
)

colnames(family) <- c('New Names', 'New Age', 'New Height')

rownames(family) <- c('me', 'myself', 'and', 'I')

family[3, 2] = 112

family
```
